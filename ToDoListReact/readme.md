This is very beautiful project created by me using react. 
Just create an react-next-app and then copy paste the contents of these files in your folder. Finally use the command- "npm run dev" to run this todo list project successfully.
This is the my beginning in react and hence I have created this simple project in react.
React with next js has become very powerful..
Huge love for react....
